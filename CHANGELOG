# Changelog

## v0.1.5 -- 2025-08-21

API Document Fix:

ByteDance's public CDN static resource library has recently been taken offline. The website states that the shutdown was due to illegal activities.

Thanks for previous ByteDance's share in the past years.

Changes to Sustech CDN mirror for now.

## v0.1.4 -- 2025-07-21

Enhancements:

- Added `balance_partition`.

Fix:

- Typos checked by codespell.

## v0.1.3 -- 2025-07-17

Fix:

- use `-fPIC` (`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`) unconditionally (in most cases it is useful for static library build).
- some platforms will build library in `lib64` instead of `lib`; this version will allow `lib64` to be detected. 

## v0.1.2 -- 2025-06-24

Enhancements:

- Added support of `int1e_grids` related integrals;
- Added minimal traceback info (where code raises error) for error handling;
- Modified `cargo:rerun-if-env-changed` related code in build.rs, so that cargo will not frequently rebuild `libcint-src`.

## v0.1.1 -- 2025-06-19

Enhancements:

- Added `from_json` and `to_json` methods, corresponds to `mol.dumps()` in PySCF.
- Added legacy initializers `initial_r2c` and `initial_r2c_with_ecp`.
