# Changelog

## v0.2.1 -- 2025-12-10

API Breaking Change:

- Change `BLKSIZE` from 56 to 48. This affects `CInt::get_integral_screen` and related `non0tab` functionalities. 48 refers to even-number of SIMD lanes (16 for AVX-512 f64). Multiple SIMD lanes are more friendly for microkernel implementation (register pressure).
  - We probably reserve the future change to `BLKSIZE` value, but will first try to make it be configurable by template parameter.

## v0.2.0 -- 2025-12-02

Major Enhancements:

- Added GTO evaluation on grids `CInt::eval_gto` and related functionalities, corresponding to PySCF's `mol.eval_ao`.

## v0.1.6 -- 2025-11-14

MSRV Specified to 1.82.0, downgrade edition to 2021 for better compatibility.

## v0.1.5 -- 2025-08-21

API Document Fix:

ByteDance's public CDN static resource library has recently been taken offline. The website states that the shutdown was due to illegal activities.

Thanks for previous ByteDance's share in the past years.

Changes to Sustech CDN mirror for now.

## v0.1.4 -- 2025-07-21

Enhancements:

- Added `balance_partition`.

Fix:

- Typos checked by codespell.

## v0.1.3 -- 2025-07-17

Fix:

- use `-fPIC` (`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`) unconditionally (in most cases it is useful for static library build).
- some platforms will build library in `lib64` instead of `lib`; this version will allow `lib64` to be detected. 

## v0.1.2 -- 2025-06-24

Enhancements:

- Added support of `int1e_grids` related integrals;
- Added minimal traceback info (where code raises error) for error handling;
- Modified `cargo:rerun-if-env-changed` related code in build.rs, so that cargo will not frequently rebuild `libcint-src`.

## v0.1.1 -- 2025-06-19

Enhancements:

- Added `from_json` and `to_json` methods, corresponds to `mol.dumps()` in PySCF.
- Added legacy initializers `initial_r2c` and `initial_r2c_with_ecp`.
